<!-- ABOUT -->
## About The Project
Iotapass is a free-to-use password manager application, designed for desktop computers. You can:
* Create, read, update, and delete your passwords for websites.
* Scan your saved passwords to see if they were found in data breaches, using data from the [Pwned Passwords API](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3#PwnedPasswords).
* Generate ideas for passwords.

This was created as a project for the class SWE6623 - Software Engineering at Kennesaw State University, under the supervision of Prof. Nick Murphy.
